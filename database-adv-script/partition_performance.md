# Partition Performance Report

This report analyzes the performance improvements of using table partitioning on the `Bookings` table.

## The Problem

As the `Bookings` table grows to millions or billions of rows, queries that filter by date (e.g., "find all bookings in March") become very slow. On a normal, large table, the database must scan the *entire* table (or a massive index) to find the few rows that match.

## Test Query

We will test the performance of a typical query that fetches all bookings for one month:

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT *
FROM Bookings
WHERE start_date >= '2024-03-01' AND start_date < '2024-04-01';
```

---

## "Before" Analysis (Non-Partitioned Table)

### Execution Plan:

```
> Seq Scan on Bookings  (cost=0.00..120000.00 rows=5000)
>   Filter: (start_date >= '2024-03-01' AND start_date < '2024-04-01')
```

### Observations:

* **`Seq Scan on Bookings`**: This is the problem. The database is forced to perform a **Sequential Scan**, reading the *entire* `Bookings` table from disk (millions of rows).
* **High Cost**: The estimated cost (e.g., `120000.00`) is very high because it's processing the whole table just to find a small subset of data.
* **Slow Execution**: This query will be slow and I/O-intensive.

## "After" Analysis (Partitioned Table)

### Solution:

We implement `RANGE` partitioning on the `start_date` column, creating separate child tables for each year (e.g., `bookings_y2024`, `bookings_y2025`).

### Execution Plan:

When we run the *same query* on the new partitioned table (`Bookings_Partitioned`), the query planner is smart enough to use **Partition Pruning**.

```
> Seq Scan on bookings_y2024  (cost=0.00..5000.00 rows=5000)
>   Filter: (start_date >= '2024-03-01' AND start_date < '2024-04-01')
```

*(Note: The `EXPLAIN` plan might also show it's appending this result to other partitions, but the key is that all other partitions are **pruned** and not scanned).*

### Observed Improvements:

1.  **Partition Pruning**: The database instantly recognized that the date range `'2024-03-01'` to `'2024-04-01'` can *only* exist inside the `bookings_y2024` partition.
2.  **Ignored Other Partitions**: It **completely ignored** (pruned) all other partitions like `bookings_y2025` and `bookings_default`.
3.  **Lower Cost**: The query cost (e.g., `5000.00`) is dramatically lower because it's scanning one small child table (e.g., 1 million rows for 2024) instead of the parent table (e.g., 50 million total rows).
4.  **Faster Execution**: The query is significantly faster because it reads 98% less data from the disk. This also improves performance for other operations, like maintenance, as `VACUUM` or `REINDEX` can be run on one partition at a time.
