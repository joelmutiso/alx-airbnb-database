üöÄ ALX Airbnb Database ModuleWelcome to the ALX Airbnb Database project! This repository contains the complete database module, from conceptual design to a fully populated, runnable SQL database. This file serves as the central documentation for the entire project.üó∫Ô∏è 1. DataScape & ER DiagramThe Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram provides a high-level, visual blueprint of our database. It defines the "what" (our data entities) and the "how" (their relationships).<details><summary><strong>View Entities & Attributes</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>üë§ Useruser_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the user.email: User's email (Unique, Not Null).password_hash: Hashed password (Not Null).first_name: User's first name.last_name: User's last name.phone_number: User's contact number.created_at: Timestamp of account creation.üè† Propertyproperty_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the property.host_id (Foreign Key -> User): The user who owns/lists the property.title: Title of the listing.description: Detailed description (TEXT).address: Physical address.city: City.country: Country.property_type: e.g., 'Apartment', 'House', 'Guest House'.price_per_night: Cost per night (DECIMAL).max_guests: Maximum number of guests (INTEGER).bedrooms: Number of bedrooms.bathrooms: Number of bathrooms.created_at: Timestamp of listing creation.üóìÔ∏è Bookingbooking_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the booking.guest_id (Foreign Key -> User): The user who made the booking.property_id (Foreign Key -> Property): The property being booked.check_in_date: Start date of the booking (DATE).check_out_date: End date of the booking (DATE).total_price: The total calculated price for the stay (DECIMAL).status: e.g., 'Pending', 'Confirmed', 'Cancelled' (ENUM type).booked_at: Timestamp of when the booking was made.‚≠ê Reviewreview_id (Primary Key): Unique identifier for the review.booking_id (Foreign Key -> Booking): The booking this review is for (Unique).guest_id (Foreign Key -> User): The user who wrote the review.property_id (Foreign Key -> Property): The property being reviewed.rating: Star rating (e.g., 1-5) (INTEGER).comment: The review text (TEXT).created_at: Timestamp of review submission.</details><details><summary><strong>View Relationships</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>User to Property (Hosting):A User can own (host) zero or many Properties.A Property is owned by exactly one User.(One-to-Many: User <-> Property)User to Booking (Guesting):A User (as a guest) can make zero or many Bookings.A Booking is made by exactly one User.(One-to-Many: User <-> Booking)Property to Booking:A Property can have zero or many Bookings.A Booking is for exactly one Property.(One-to-Many: Property <-> Booking)Booking to Review:A Booking can have zero or one Review. (This is enforced by a unique constraint on booking_id in the Reviews table).A Review is for exactly one Booking.(One-to-One: Booking <-> Review)</details>‚ú® 2. Database Normalization (3NF)To ensure our database is efficient, scalable, and free of errors, we've normalized it to the Third Normal Form (3NF).1NF (First Normal Form): All column values are atomic (indivisible). We've done this (e.g., we don't store "WiFi, Pool" in a single amenities column).2NF (Second Normal Form): All non-key attributes fully depend on the entire primary key. Our single-column primary keys (like user_id) automatically satisfy this.3NF (Third Normal Form): We have no transitive dependencies.What's a Transitive Dependency?It's when a non-key column depends on another non-key column, not on the primary key.Bad Design: Properties(property_id, host_id, host_email)Problem: host_email depends on host_id, which depends on property_id. This is a transitive dependency. If a host's email changes, we'd have to update it on every property they own.3NF Solution (Our Design): We move host_email where it belongs:Users(user_id, email, ...)Properties(property_id, host_id, ...)Now, email is only stored once in the Users table. We find it by joining the tables. This eliminates redundancy and prevents update errors.üèóÔ∏è 3. Database Schema (DDL)The DDL (Data Definition Language) script creates the structure of our database. It builds the empty tables, columns, constraints, and indexes.<details><summary><strong>View schema.sql Code</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>-- Drops all tables if they exist to ensure a clean slate.

</details>‚öôÔ∏è How to Run This ProjectYou can set up the entire database in two simple steps.Step 1: Create the Database StructureFirst, create your database in PostgreSQL (e.g., alx_airbnb). Then, run the DDL script to build the tables.psql -U <your_username> -d alx_airbnb -f database-script-0x01/schema.sql
Step 2: Populate the DatabaseRun the DML script to fill your new tables with sample data.psql -U <your_username> -d alx_airbnb -f database-script-0x02/seed.sql
Your database is now fully built, populated, and ready to be connected to your application!
