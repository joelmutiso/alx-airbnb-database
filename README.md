# üöÄ ALX Airbnb Database Module

Welcome to the ALX Airbnb Database project! This repository contains the complete database module, from conceptual design to a fully populated, runnable SQL database. This file serves as the central documentation for the entire project.

## üó∫Ô∏è 1. DataScape & ER Diagram

The Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram provides a high-level, visual blueprint of our database. It defines the "what" (our data entities) and the "how" (their relationships).

**Note:** The image below is a placeholder. You should upload the `airbnb_erd.png` image I generated for you into the `ERD/` directory for this link to work.

<summary><strong>View Relationships</strong> (Click to expand)</summary>

* **User to Property (Hosting):**
    * A `User` can *own* (host) **zero or many** `Properties`.
    * A `Property` is *owned* by **exactly one** `User`.
    * (One-to-Many: `User` <-> `Property`)

* **User to Booking (Guesting):**
    * A `User` (as a guest) can *make* **zero or many** `Bookings`.
    * A `Booking` is *made* by **exactly one** `User`.
    * (One-to-Many: `User` <-> `Booking`)

* **Property to Booking:**
    * A `Property` can *have* **zero or many** `Bookings`.
    * A `Booking` is *for* **exactly one** `Property`.
    * (One-to-Many: `Property` <-> `Booking`)

* **Booking to Review:**
    * A `Booking` can *have* **zero or one** `Review`. (This is enforced by a unique constraint on `booking_id` in the `Reviews` table).
    * A `Review` is *for* **exactly one** `Booking`.
    * (One-to-One: `Booking` <-> `Review`)

## ‚ú® 2. Database Normalization (3NF)

To ensure our database is efficient, scalable, and free of errors, we've normalized it to the **Third Normal Form (3NF)**.

* **1NF (First Normal Form):** All column values are atomic (indivisible). We've done this (e.g., we don't store "WiFi, Pool" in a single `amenities` column).
* **2NF (Second Normal Form):** All non-key attributes fully depend on the entire primary key. Our single-column primary keys (like `user_id`) automatically satisfy this.
* **3NF (Third Normal Form):** We have no *transitive dependencies*.

**What's a Transitive Dependency?**
It's when a non-key column depends on *another* non-key column, not on the primary key.

* **Bad Design:** `Properties(property_id, host_id, host_email)`
* **Problem:** `host_email` depends on `host_id`, which depends on `property_id`. This is a transitive dependency. If a host's email changes, we'd have to update it on *every property they own*.
* **3NF Solution (Our Design):** We move `host_email` where it belongs:
    * `Users(user_id, email, ...)`
    * `Properties(property_id, host_id, ...)`

Now, `email` is only stored once in the `Users` table. We find it by joining the tables. This eliminates redundancy and prevents update errors.

## üèóÔ∏è 3. Database Schema (DDL)

The **DDL (Data Definition Language)** script creates the *structure* of our database. It builds the empty tables, columns, constraints, and indexes.
